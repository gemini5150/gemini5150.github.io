        <p><strong>
            Emilio's professional history has been revolved around children.  He first started his work with kids at a drop in art center called Plaster Fun Time in MA.  This was a very hands on and kid focused business.  The main impetus was to have children express themselves creatively through their own art style with no parameter.  It allowed Emilio to encourage out of the box thinking, and of the fly conversations with many different and divers children.  Most kids would gravitate towards his upbeat and joyful demeanor.  Most kids are inhibited creatively and never really get the spot light shined on them in such a positive and friendly way.  As being one of the most requested for Birthday parties, he began to have a loyal following.  He was able to reach so many children at one time that way.  As the parents physically saw the delight on their children faces, he was proposed to babysit.
